Functions

make_hist - flipping the axis (raster vs "usual" maths)
          - bins
          - size_t vs unsigned (efficiency)
          
apply_kernel_hist - article, time measure
                  - two main filters -> square vs gauss
                  - always odd size kernel
                  - convolution, symmetric filters
                  
colorize_hist - internally rasterization
              - working with integers
              - palette of colors according to hist values
              
colorize_data - make_raster rgba matrix
              - using rgbwt matrix
              - internally in floats
              - easy/matrix operations in R (optimal)
              - one color or each point has own color
              - cache optimal in R, some operations
            
apply_kernel_data -rgbwt (circle) and rgba(gauss) matrices
                  -return list or raster (colorize_data too) 
                  - sigma and radius

Description

Fast Scatterplots with More Data Points

C-based coversion of large scatterplot data to R
    structure or raster. Speeds up plotting of large data with millions of
    points.
