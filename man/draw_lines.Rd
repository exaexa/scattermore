\usage{
draw_lines(
  xy,
  xlim = c(min(xy), max(xy)),
  ylim = c(min(xy), max(xy)),
  out_size = c(512, 512),
  RGBA = c(0, 0, 0, 255)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xy}{Vector with 4 elements or matrix or array (4xn dim, n >= 2, n ~ xy rows)
with the line's begin and start point, for vector format is
\verb{(x_begin, y_begin, x_end, y_end)}, for matrices similarly. As usual with
rasters in R, X axis grows right, and Y axis grows DOWN.
Flipping \code{ylim} causes the "usual" mathematical behavior.}

\item{xlim}{Limits as usual (position of the first pixel on the
left/top, and the last pixel on the right/bottom), 2-element vector.
You can easily flip the top/bottom to the "usual" mathematical
system by flipping the \code{ylim} vector.}

\item{ylim}{Limits as usual (position of the first pixel on the
left/top, and the last pixel on the right/bottom), 2-element vector.
You can easily flip the top/bottom to the "usual" mathematical
system by flipping the \code{ylim} vector.}

\item{out_size}{2-element vector size of the result raster,
defaults to \code{c(512,512)}.}

\item{RGBA}{Vector with 4 elements or matrix or array (4xn dim, n >= 2, n ~ xy rows) with R, G, B
and alpha channels in integers, defaults to \code{c(0,0,0,255)}.}
}
\value{
An array in RGBWT format with the scatterplot output.
}
\description{
Create histogram from given point coordinates.
